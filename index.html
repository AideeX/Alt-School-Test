            <h2 class="headings">AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h2>
            <p>I am a daughter of Zion, in my 30s, married to an amazing man and a mother of 2 adorable boys. I come from a family of 5, my parents and 2 younger brothers. Coincidentally my husband has 4 brothers and so I have been surrounded my boys/men my entire life. I have a Bachelor's degree in English & Literary Studies and an MBA. Even though my background is in the Arts, I have always had an affinity for Tech. My dream has always been to be a "girl in tech". I am an avid reader, I love food, I enjoy watching movies and generally having a good time.</p>
